# Abstract :
The dynamic pricing structure of the aviation sector is a challenge to both airlines and passengers seeking effective revenue management and transparent fare information. The "Flight Fare Prediction System" is an inventive use of machine learning designed to transform the process of determining flight fares in response to this.
The goal of this project is to create a strong machine learning model that can accurately anticipate flight costs by using real-time and historical data in conjunction with sophisticated analytics. By providing airlines with the capacity to dynamically optimize fares in response to market dynamics, demand changes, and other influencing factors, the system seeks to go beyond the constraints of conventional rule-based pricing systems.

# Problem Statement :
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and 
more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or 
decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, 
destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive 
season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will 
surely help many people save money and time.
The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in 
the provided dataset.

# Objectives :
 **Build a Predictive Model:** - Construct a machine learning model that can reliably forecast airfares using both historical and current data.
 
 **Optimize Pricing Strategies:** - Apply the predictive model to dynamically optimize airline pricing strategies taking competitive pricing, seasonal trends, and fluctuations in demand into account.
 
 **Improve Revenue Management:** - Make better judgments about price changes and marketing campaigns by using the predictive model to revenue management for airlines.
 
 **Improve Passenger Transparency:**  - Give passengers more information on fare structures, including precise estimates and intelligible explanations of the variables determining.
